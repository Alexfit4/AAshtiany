		<h2>Why I'm here</h2>

		<p>
			The main reason I decided to take the GW Bootcamp was to start a new
			career. I'm currently a personal trainer, but before Covid I was doing
			very well, worked about 55hours a week and things were looking good.
			<br />
			Then Covid stuck and I lost a bunch of clients, and that made me realize I
			need to find a job more stable and secure. Yes I'm still training clients
			online but as an independent contractor and being self employed, <br />
			getting more clients and going back to where I was is going to be a
			challenge. So while I have this time of being home and working from home,
			I decided to join GW Bootcamp to start my journey in the IT field.
